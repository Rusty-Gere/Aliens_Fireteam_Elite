 (This is the latest version confirmed to work with the MOD. Anything later should also be fine).

2. Download the Aliens: Fireteam Elite UEVR MOD from [HERE](https://github.com/Rusty-Gere/Aliens_Fireteam_Elite/releases/tag/First_release)

3. Run the UEVR injector, then click "Import Config" in the left-hand menu.
Navigate to where you saved the MOD, it should be named "Endeavor-Win64-Shipping.zip", click on the file to import.

4. With UEVR injector running, launch the game, tab to UEVR injector, locate the game in the process dropdown list, and click Inject.

>[!TIP]
>Grab [Raipal](https://github.com/Raicuparta/rai-pal) and use that instead to simplify the whole injection process.

## 

> [!NOTE]
> * All controls are explained in the custom UI when you run the game with the MOD installed, and is contextual to Right- and Left-handed mode.
> * When the game starts for the first time with this MOD installed, you will see a custom UI with various Options and the Controls overview.
If it doesn't show by itself, hit the Ins key or click both controller sticks, then click on the GRIP tab.
> * In general, the gesture controls should feel completely natural. You place the controller in the relevant area and press the grip button.
For example, grab primary weapon over shoulder, grab pistol from hip, apply first-aid at mouth or chest, etc.
If in doubt or stuck, just view the controls overview in the MOD UI screen.
> * When manually reloading (grab ammo from hip, hold grip and release at gun), you won't see actual ammo in your hand. Just pretend it's there. :)
> * Motion direction is where you point the gun, this makes it easier to run one way while looking in another direction.
> * The ADS Reticle is attached to the weapon and appears when you activate ADS. For best accuracy, aim down the gun's actual sights as you would IRL.
> * When you toggle the HUD off, be aware that you won't see the 'interact' (X) prompts (terminals, NPCs).
> * Shoulder swap function is disabled as it breaks first-person VR when engaged.
> * Dev'd and tested on Quest 3, but should work with any HMD and controller set.

## Footnote
V1.0 published on 17 Nov 2025

I started working on this MOD three months ago from scratch, knowing nothing about either Lua or the UE engine at the time. My plan back then was something much simpler, but as I learned more and experimented more, feature creep set in and this ended being a far more extensive MOD than originally planned. I hope you find as much enjoyment out of playing it as what I did in overcoming the challenge of creating it.

To other aspiring modders out there, it really is true, you can just do things. :)
